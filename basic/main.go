package main

// These are foundational topics, great for beginners (Easy).
// Examples are listed at the end.

import "fmt"

// Entry point of the application.
// The `main` function serves as the starting point of execution for this program.

func main() {
	// This line serves as a simple message printed to the console from the main file.
	fmt.Println("This line will come from main function file.")

	// Core Concepts (Basic Foundations):
	// Uncomment to explore.

	// Suggestion: Start with HELLO
	// hello()         //→ Start with the classic "Hello, World!" program.

	// Easy:
	// data_types()    //→ Demonstrates the use of various data types in Go (int, float, bool, string).
	// arrays()        //→ Learn about arrays, their fixed size, and how to manipulate them.
	// slices()        //→ Explore slices for dynamic array-like functionality in Go.

	// Medium:
	// maps()          //→ Understand maps for key-value pair data structures.
	// pointers()      //→ Discover pointers (`*` and `&`) to work with memory addresses.

	// Control Structures:
	// Learn control flow techniques to direct program execution.

	// Easy:
	// loops()         //→ Explore different types of loops (for, range) and their usage.
	// ifelse()        //→ Work with conditionals using if-else and if-else if-else ladder constructs.

	// Functions:
	// Learn how to structure reusable code with functions.

	// Easy:
	// functionsDemo() //→ Dive into basic functions, variadic functions, and anonymous functions.

	// Medium:
	// namedReturns()  //→ Learn about named return values and how they simplify return statements.

	// Practice Project:
	// These projects range in difficulty and are designed to integrate multiple concepts.

	// Easy:
	// calculator()          //→ Practice combining all these concepts into a mini calculator project.
	// multiplicationTable() //→ Generate multiplication tables dynamically.

	// Medium:
	// convertTemperature()  //→ Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
	 bankAccountManager()  //→ Simulate a basic bank account management system.

	// Hard:
	// toDoListApp()         //→ Create a basic to-do list app to manage tasks dynamically with persistence.
